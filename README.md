<h3>Suffix tree/ Suffix array</h3>

⭐ Why cant we calculate complexity in seconds?
- Not every computer is equally powerfull.

⭐ If we have a tree of n nodes, how many edges will it have?
- In any tree EDGE is connecting link between two nodes.

n-1 edges

Thus every tree on n vertices has n-1 edges.


⭐ Which of the following data structures can handle updates and queries in log(n) time on an array?

- You can use 'Segment Tree'. In segment tress both update and query time is O(logn).

Time complexity and big o notaion --harry video

Actually space complexity =input size + auxillary space

but geerally we look into auxilalry space to calculate because ---
